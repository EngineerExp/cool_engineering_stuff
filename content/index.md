# Cool Engineering Stuff

## Just doing more testing...
Currently there is not much I am doing since I am modifying the generator for this website. 

Stuff be a bit complicated... added a script within src/main to be able to open Chrome to either the local test, or the website after pushing to git.

__TESTING... IS THIS REAL LIFE?__

```
# this is some code
result = function(something)
print(result)
```


### Is this a Rick Roll?
#### Maybe...
